# Website Scraper
This is a program that will scrape a website (in this case google) and show where a certain input string can be found in which results. 
It can be used to check how well a company is doing in SEO for a certain set of search terms.

This was originally part of a coding challenge to create an over-designed application using .NET MVC for seeing where a company name appeared in the top 100 google search results for certain keywords.
Part of the requirements were to avoid using HTMLAgilityPack or a similar service to scrape the data on the website, but to still follow clean coding practices.

Also part of the requirements were to make it a single-page application using KnockoutJS to handle the front-end.
